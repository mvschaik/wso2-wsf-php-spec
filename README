Files needed to create a wso2-wsf-php RPM for RHEL6/CentOS6.

The resulting RPM stays as close as possible to the pristine installation
from WSO2. By doing so, it violates a lot of packaging guidelines; a local
installation of WSF/C, used by the PHP module, is installed in
$(libdir)/php/modules/wsf_c. To be able to references WSF/C in this location,
the module uses fixed rpaths, which is another violation.

Differences from installation from source:
 * The /samples directory from WSF/C is removed. It contained pre-compiled
   executables that refer to an unavailable version of libssl, which would
   result in dependency problems when installing the RPM.
 * The documentation is moved from /usr/share to /usr/share/doc/<packagename>.
 * The samples directory included in the source is also copied to the doc
   directory.
 * The scripts are copied to /usr/share/<packagename>/scripts.
 * Logging is configured to go to /var/log/<packagename>, level WARNING by
   default.
 * Configuration can be done in /etc/php.d/wsf.ini

Usage:
1. Create a user for package building
2. Login as this user and run 'rpmdev-setuptree'
3. Create a file ~/.wgetrc with 'timestamping = on' in it
4. Remove the line '%__arch_install_post   /usr/lib/rpm/check-rpaths
    /usr/lib/rpm/check-buildroot' from ~/.rpmmacros
5. Copy wso2-wsf-php.spec to rpmbuild/SPECS
6. Copy patch files to rpmbuild/SOURCES
7. Download http://dist.wso2.org/products/wsf/php/2.1.0/wso2-wsf-php-src-2.1.0.tar.gz
   to rpmbuild/SOURCES
8. Run rpmbuild -ba rpmbuild/SPECS/wso2-wsf-php.spec to build the rpms
